# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

As human beings’ speech is amongst the most natural way to express ourselves. We depend so much on it that we recognize its importance when resorting to other communication forms like emails and text messages where we often use emojis to express the emotions associated with the messages. As emotions play a vital role in communication, the detection and analysis of the same is of vital importance in today’s digital world of remote communication. Emotion detection is a challenging task, because emotions are subjective. There is no common consensus on how to measure or categorize them. We define a SER system as a collection of methodologies that process and classify speech signals to detect emotions embedded in them. Such a system can find use in a wide variety of application areas like interactive voice based-assistant or caller-agent conversation analysis. In this study we attempt to detect underlying emotions in recorded speech by analysing the acoustic features of the audio data of recordings.
